# Project: Data Modeling with Postgres

## Introduction

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.



## Project Description

In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, you will need to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.



## Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```json
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```



## Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

If you would like to look at the JSON data within log_data files, you will need to create a pandas dataframe to read the data. Remember to first import JSON and pandas libraries.

```python
df = pd.read_json(filepath, lines=True)
```

For example,

```python
df = pd.read_json('data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-01-events.json', lines=True)
```

would read the data file 2018-11-01-events.json.



## Schema for Song Play Analysis

Using the song and log datasets, create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

#### Fact Table

1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page `NextSong`
   * *songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent*

#### Dimension Tables

1. **users**\- users in the app
   - *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*
2. **songs**\- songs in music database
   - *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*
3. **artists**\- artists in music database
   - *artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude*
4. **time**\- timestamps of records in**songplays**broken down into specific units
   - *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*

## Project Template

The  final project package includes six files:

1. `test.ipynb` displays the first few rows of each table to let you check your database.
2. `create_tables.py` drops and creates your tables. You run this file to reset your tables before each time you run your ETL scripts.
3. `etl.ipynb` reads and processes a single file from `song_data` and `log_data` and loads the data into your tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
4. `etl.py` reads and processes files from `song_data` and `log_data` and loads them into your tables. You can fill this out based on your work in the ETL notebook.
5. `sql_queries.py` contains all sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.
6. `README.md` provides discussion on project.



## Project Steps

Below are steps  to complete the project:

### Create Tables

1. Write `CREATE` statements in `sql_queries.py` to create each table.
2. Write `DROP` statements in `sql_queries.py` to drop each table if it exists.
3. Run `create_tables.py` to create your database and tables.
4. Run `test.ipynb` to confirm the creation of your tables with the correct columns. Make sure to click "Restart kernel" to close the connection to the database after running this notebook.

### Build ETL Processes

Follow instructions in the `etl.ipynb` notebook to develop ETL processes for each table. At the end of each table section, or at the end of the notebook, run `test.ipynb` to confirm that records were successfully inserted into each table. Remember to rerun `create_tables.py` to reset your tables before each time you run this notebook.

### ETL Pipeline Schema

1. `Song data` will generate `songs table` and `artist table`. 
2. `Log data` will generate `time table` and `user table`.
3. The fact table `songplays table` is generated by `songs table`, `artist table`, and `log data`. The sql query `song select` in `sql_queries.py` would achieve it. 

## Project Rubric

Read the project [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2500/view) before and during development of your project to ensure you meet all specifications.

## Project Result

The `test.ipynb` can test the fact and dimension table in PostgreSQL database. I also used the `Postico` application to look our database.

## Further Improvment

* The `etl.py` will run whole ETL progress for this project, however, the execution time is a little bit longer because the ETL progress will load all source sound files data and log data files into data frame format and then transfer data frame to target table. The improvement work is that can extract, transfer each files into data frame and load to target table one by one, it may increase the who ETL execution speed.
